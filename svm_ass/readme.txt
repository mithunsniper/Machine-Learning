Files to run:

onevsall_code.py - contains code for one vs one svm classification for all four kernels.
onevsone_code.py - contains code for one vs all svm classification for all four kernels.
weighted_code.py - contains code for weighted svm classification for all four kernels.

All the three .py files read 'glass_dataset.csv' file as input.

ovo_alloutputs.txt - contains the accuracies for all the hyperparameters' values tested for one vs one procedure to determine the optimal hyperparameters.
ova_alloutputs.txt - contains the accuracies for all the hyperparameters' values tested for one vs all procedure to determine the optimal hyperparameters.
weighted_allouputs.txt- contains the accuracies for all the hyperparameters' values tested for weighted procedure to determine the optimal hyperparameters.
